 * Identifier for parties in a demographic or identity service. There are typically a number of subtypes of the `PARTY` class, including `PERSON`, `ORGANISATION`, etc. Abstract supertypes are allowed if the referenced object is of a type not known by the current implementation of this class (in other words, if the demographic model is changed by the addition of a new `PARTY` or `ACTOR` subtypes, valid `PARTY_REFs` can still be constructed to them).
